    "### Publishing the image\n",
    "For the first step we start by building the image and adding a `tag` to it:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ docker build . --tag YOUR-IMAGE-TAG\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now that we have a built image with a tag, we can set its target path in [Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling#add-registry), including the gcr.io registry host and the project ID of `YOUR-PROJECT-ID`:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ docker tag YOUR-IMAGE-TAG gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-TAG\n",
    "```\n",
    "The final step of publishing the image is to push it to the registry. To do this just run:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ docker push gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-TAG\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now your image is published! The Container Registry adds the registry to your project, creates a storage bucket for the registry, and stores the image. For more information please refer to [their guides](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pushing the published image to a run environment\n",
    "We will use the [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) to run the image that we have published.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ gcloud run deploy YOUR-IMAGE-TAG --image gcr.io/YOUR-PROJECT-ID/YOUR-IMAGE-TAG\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Caveats\n",
    "Google Cloud Run uses [autoscaling](https://cloud.google.com/run#all-features) which means that it scales from zero to N containers depending on the traffic recieved. This means that if your site recieves no traffic it will scale down to zero instances after 15 minutes and thus stop sending data with the background scheduler. As this containers main purpose is write to Clarify with a background scheduler, we want it to be only one container at all times. We can set this in [the console](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/min-instances#setting) or with the command:\n",
