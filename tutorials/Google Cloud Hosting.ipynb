    "In this tutorial, we will create a docker image and deploy it to Google Cloud. The docker image will use the [PyClarify](https://pypi.org/project/pyclarify/) package which provides a fast and easy way to get data from Clarify and write data back. For more details on how to use click [here](https://searis.github.io/pyclarify/) for the documentation. In the docker image, we will also use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) but feel free to use any API you prefer.\n",

    "It is highly recommended that you have gone through the [Introduction Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/searis/data-science-tutorials/blob/main/tutorials/Introduction.ipynb) for the basics of using PyClarify. This tutorial is will not go into details about how to use PyClarify.
